# WHYTEGOD

**Neutral research infrastructure for decentralized systems**

WHYTEGOD is an independent, AI-first, non-custodial research initiative focused on documenting verifiable on-chain state changes across decentralized protocols.

It does not custody funds, execute transactions, issue incentives, or provide financial advice.

## Why WHYTEGOD Exists

Most participants react to narratives.

Narratives come **after** decisions.

In decentralized systems:
- Capital moves first
- Control changes first
- Governance executes first

Stories follow.

WHYTEGOD exists to preserve **state reality** — not sentiment, not marketing, not interpretation.

## What WHYTEGOD Is

- A **protocol observatory**
- A **public research interface**
- A **historical record of on-chain state**

WHYTEGOD documents:
- Governance executions
- Parameter changes
- Permission updates
- Structural protocol shifts

All anchored to verifiable on-chain sources.

## What WHYTEGOD Is Not

- ❌ Not a wallet  
- ❌ Not a trading platform  
- ❌ Not an investment product  
- ❌ Not a DAO  
- ❌ Not an influencer outlet  

WHYTEGOD does not recommend, rank, predict, score, or influence outcomes.

## Core Principles

- **Neutrality**  
  Observation without opinion.

- **Non-custodial design**  
  No funds, no keys, no execution.

- **Transparency**  
  Every claim must map to verifiable state.

- **User sovereignty**  
  Interpretation belongs to the reader.

## Design Philosophy

WHYTEGOD follows a **reality-first systems approach**:

- Minimize interpretation

If something cannot be verified, it is not recorded.
