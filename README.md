# Whytegod Protocol

Whytegod is a fixed-supply, privacy-preserving protocol for permanent record anchoring.

The protocol prioritizes mathematical certainty, neutrality, and long-term
verifiability over expressiveness, governance, or speculative flexibility.

Whytegod is not a platform.
Whytegod is not a smart-contract system.
Whytegod is not governed by votes.
