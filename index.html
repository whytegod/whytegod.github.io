    <!-- HERO -->
    <h1>WHYTEGOD</h1>
    <p class="tagline">
      A decentralized, AI-assisted peer-to-peer coordination layer for global value exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD is not an exchange, not a bank, and not a company.
      It is infrastructure — designed to help ordinary people access blockchain
      coordination without custody, permission, or centralized control.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <!-- WHITEPAPER -->
    <h2>Whitepaper</h2>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      WHYTEGOD introduces a new coordination primitive: AI-assisted peer discovery
      and trust-minimized interaction without asset custody.
      The protocol lowers the cognitive and technical barrier to blockchain participation.
    </p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Existing blockchain access is dominated by centralized exchanges,
      custodial wallets, complex interfaces, and regulatory gatekeeping.
      This excludes billions of people and re-centralizes a system
      that was meant to be permissionless.
    </p>

    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p>
      WHYTEGOD enables individuals to coordinate directly with one another,
      guided by intelligence but governed by sovereignty.
      No accounts. No custody. No intermediaries.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Principles</h3>
    <p>
      • Non-custodial by design<br>
      • Permissionless access<br>
      • AI as guidance, not authority<br>
      • Decentralization over convenience<br>
      • Gradual, organic evolution
    </p>

    <!-- TECHNOLOGY PAPER -->
    <h2>Technology Paper</h2>

    <h3>Architecture Overview</h3>
    <p>
      WHYTEGOD operates as a coordination layer, not a settlement layer.
      It does not hold funds, process transactions, or enforce outcomes.
      Settlement occurs on external blockchains chosen by participants.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Assistance Layer</h3>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence assists users by reducing errors,
      clarifying trade paths, and helping match peers —
      without removing final decision-making from humans.
    </p>

    <h3>Security Model</h3>
    <p>
      Security emerges from absence of custody,
      minimized attack surfaces,
      peer verification,
      and protocol simplicity.
    </p>

    <h3>Chain & Asset Agnostic</h3>
    <p>
      WHYTEGOD is not bound to any blockchain, token, or asset.
      It adapts to multiple ecosystems without dependency.
    </p>

    <!-- ROADMAP -->
    <h2>Roadmap</h2>

    <h3>Phase 1 — Ideation</h3>
    <p>
      Define the philosophical foundation, values, and non-negotiable principles
      that prevent future centralization.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 2 — Public Narrative</h3>
    <p>
      Publish a clear, honest explanation of the system without hype,
      false promises, or speculative guarantees.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 3 — Minimal Presence</h3>
    <p>
      Deploy a lightweight, static site accessible globally,
      usable from low-end devices, and resistant to censorship.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 4 — Community Understanding</h3>
    <p>
      Educate early participants on principles, risks, and responsibilities
      of decentralized coordination.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 5 — AI Guidance Experiments</h3>
    <p>
      Introduce AI-assisted guidance tools in controlled, transparent stages
      without custody or enforcement.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 6 — Protocol Hardening</h3>
    <p>
      Stress-test assumptions, refine coordination logic,
      and eliminate hidden centralization vectors.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 7 — Organic Expansion</h3>
    <p>
      Allow WHYTEGOD to grow naturally through adoption,
      not marketing pressure or speculative incentives.
    </p>

    <!-- FINAL -->
    <h2>Final Note</h2>
    <p>
      WHYTEGOD is intentionally slow, minimal, and resistant to hype.
      Its strength lies in clarity, restraint, and decentralization.
