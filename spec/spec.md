# Whytegod Protocol — Specification

## 1. Purpose

The Whytegod Protocol exists to provide a neutral, permanent, and verifiable system
for anchoring cryptographic records without reliance on trust, governance, or identity.

The protocol prioritizes:

- Correctness over flexibility
- Permanence over speed
- Verification over authority

---

## 2. Native Units

The protocol defines a single native asset.

- **Primary unit:** WGD
- **Smallest unit:** Wert
- **Conversion:**  
  1 WGD = 100,000,000 Wert

Wert is indivisible.

No alternative units or denominations are recognized.

---

## 3. Supply Rules

- Total supply is fixed
- No inflation is permitted
- No discretionary minting is permitted
- No supply changes are allowed after genesis

All issuance rules are deterministic and verifiable.

---

## 4. Ownership Model

Ownership is defined strictly by cryptographic control of keys.

- No identity layer exists
- No account recovery exists
- Loss of keys results in permanent loss of funds

The protocol recognizes keys, not persons.

---

## 5. Transfer Rules

- Transfers are final once confirmed
- No reversal mechanism exists
- No arbitration or governance override exists

Validity is determined purely by protocol rules.

---

## 6. Economic Neutrality

The protocol does not target price, value, or market behavior.

- No stabilization mechanisms
- No price controls
- No demand management logic

Market value, if any, is external to the protocol.

---

## 7. Immutability

Once accepted:

- Records cannot be altered
- Supply cannot be changed
- Rules cannot be retroactively modified

Historical validity must always be preserved.

---

## 8. Scope Limits

This specification defines:

- Units
- Supply
- Ownership
- Transfer validity

This document does not define:

- Governance
- Applications
- Identity
- Legal or social interpretation

---

## 9. Finality

Whytegod Protocol is minimal, deterministic, and timeless.

Anything not explicitly permitted is implicitly disallowed.
