    <h2>Protocol Research: Uniswap</h2>

    <p>
      Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that enables
      peer-to-peer trading of digital assets without order books or intermediaries.
    </p>

    <h3>Automated Market Maker (AMM)</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of matching buyers and sellers, Uniswap uses liquidity pools.
      Prices are determined by a mathematical formula based on asset ratios.
    </p>

    <h3>Liquidity Provision</h3>
    <p>
      Users supply token pairs into pools and earn fees generated from trades.
      Liquidity providers assume risk in exchange for yield.
    </p>

    <h3>Constant Product Formula</h3>
    <p>
      Uniswap maintains the invariant x * y = k, ensuring liquidity is
      always available at algorithmically adjusted prices.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Impermanent loss</li>
      <li>Smart contract risk</li>
      <li>Oracle-free price exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD studies Uniswap as a foundational example of permissionless
      market infrastructure.

    <h2>Protocol Research: Aave</h2>

    <p>
      Aave is a decentralized liquidity protocol that enables users to lend
      and borrow digital assets without intermediaries.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Function</h3>
    <p>
      Users deposit assets into liquidity pools. These assets become available
      for borrowing by other users who provide collateral.
    </p>

    <h3>Interest Rate Model</h3>
    <p>
      Interest rates adjust algorithmically based on utilization.
      Higher demand increases borrowing costs and balances liquidity.
    </p>

    <h3>Overcollateralization</h3>
    <p>
      Borrowers must lock collateral worth more than the loan value,
      reducing default risk.
    </p>

    <h3>Liquidation System</h3>
    <p>
      Positions are automatically liquidated if collateral value
      falls below safety thresholds.
    </p>

    <h3>Flash Loans</h3>
    <p>
      Aave pioneered flash loans — loans that must be borrowed and repaid
      within a single transaction block.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Smart contract vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>Oracle dependency</li>
      <li>Liquidation risk</li>
      <li>Governance risk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD studies Aave to understand decentralized credit,
      risk management, and liquidity coordination.
