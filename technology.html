  <!-- UNISWAP -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <section class="protocol">
    <h2>Protocol Research: Uniswap</h2>

    <p>
      Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables
      peer-to-peer token trading without centralized intermediaries
      or traditional order books.
    </p>

    <h3>Automated Market Maker (AMM)</h3>
    <p>
      Uniswap replaces order books with liquidity pools.
      Prices are determined algorithmically based on token ratios.
    </p>

    <h3>Liquidity Provision</h3>
    <p>
      Users supply token pairs to pools and earn fees proportional
      to their share of liquidity.
    </p>

    <h3>Constant Product Formula</h3>
    <p>
      The protocol maintains the invariant <strong>x × y = k</strong>,
      ensuring continuous liquidity under changing market conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Impermanent loss</li>
      <li>Smart contract risk</li>
      <li>Price volatility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD studies Uniswap as a foundational coordination mechanism
      for decentralized markets.
    </p>

  <!-- ===================== -->
  <!-- AAVE -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <section class="protocol">
    <h2>Protocol Research: Aave</h2>

    <p>
      Aave is a decentralized liquidity protocol that enables
      lending and borrowing of digital assets without intermediaries.
    </p>

    <h3>Lending Pools</h3>
    <p>
      Users deposit assets into pools, making them available for borrowing
      by others who provide collateral.
    </p>

    <h3>Interest Rate Model</h3>
    <p>
      Interest rates adjust automatically based on utilization,
      balancing liquidity across the system.
    </p>

    <h3>Overcollateralization</h3>
    <p>
      Borrowers must provide collateral exceeding the value
      of the loan to reduce default risk.
    </p>

    <h3>Liquidation Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
      If collateral value drops below safety thresholds,
      positions are liquidated automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>Flash Loans</h3>
    <p>
      Aave introduced flash loans — uncollateralized loans
      that must be repaid within a single transaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Oracle dependency</li>
      <li>Liquidation risk</li>
      <li>Smart contract vulnerabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD studies Aave to understand decentralized credit,
      leverage, and automated risk management.

  <!-- ===================== -->
  <!-- MAKERDAO -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <section class="protocol">
    <h2>Protocol Research: MakerDAO</h2>

    <p>
      MakerDAO is a decentralized protocol that issues DAI,
      a crypto-collateralized stablecoin governed on-chain.
    </p>

    <h3>DAI Stablecoin</h3>
    <p>
      DAI is generated when users lock collateral into smart contracts
      and mint debt against it.
    </p>

    <h3>Vaults (CDPs)</h3>
    <p>
      Vaults enforce minimum collateral ratios to maintain system stability.
    </p>

    <h3>Stability Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>
      Stability fees, liquidation penalties, and governance controls
      are used to maintain DAI’s peg.
    </p>

    <h3>Governance</h3>
    <p>
      MKR token holders vote on risk parameters,
      collateral types, and protocol upgrades.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>De-pegging risk</li>
      <li>Governance capture</li>
      <li>Oracle failures</li>
      <li>Liquidation cascades</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD studies MakerDAO as an experiment
      in decentralized money and monetary policy.

  <!-- WHYTEGOD CORE PHILOSOPHY -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <section class="protocol philosophy">

    <h2>WHYTEGOD: Core Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD is not a protocol, token, or financial product.
      It is a research-driven coordination framework focused on
      understanding decentralized financial systems at their foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project exists to observe how markets, credit, and money behave
      when coordination is handled by code rather than institutions.
    </p>

    <h3>Foundational Focus</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Markets</strong> — decentralized exchange (Uniswap)</li>
      <li><strong>Credit</strong> — lending and leverage (Aave)</li>
      <li><strong>Money</strong> — issuance and stability (MakerDAO)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Neutrality & Non-Custodial Design</h3>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD does not custody assets, execute transactions,
      or influence financial decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project prioritizes clarity, transparency,
      and analytical neutrality.
    </p>

    <h3>Human Behavior & Risk</h3>

    <p>
      Although decentralized finance is automated,
      outcomes are shaped by human incentives,
      governance decisions, and behavioral stress.
    </p>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD focuses on where human behavior
      intersects with automated systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Long-Term Objective</h3>

    <p>
      The long-term goal is to develop open research frameworks
      that help individuals, DAOs, and institutions
      reason clearly about decentralized financial systems
      without surrendering sovereignty.
