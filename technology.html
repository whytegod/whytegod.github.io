    The objective is understanding infrastructure — not promotion.

  <!-- UNISWAP -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <section class="protocol">
    <h2>Protocol Research: Uniswap</h2>

    <p>
      Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables peer-to-peer
      token trading without order books or centralized intermediaries.
    </p>

    <h3>Automated Market Maker (AMM)</h3>
    <p>
      Uniswap replaces traditional order books with liquidity pools.
      Prices are determined algorithmically based on token ratios.
    </p>

    <h3>Liquidity Provision</h3>
    <p>
      Users supply token pairs to pools and earn trading fees proportional
      to their share of liquidity.
    </p>

    <h3>Constant Product Formula</h3>
    <p>
      The protocol maintains the invariant <strong>x × y = k</strong>,
      ensuring continuous liquidity.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Impermanent loss</li>
      <li>Smart contract risk</li>
      <li>Price volatility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD studies Uniswap as a foundational example of permissionless
      market coordination.

  <!-- AAVE -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <section class="protocol">
    <h2>Protocol Research: Aave</h2>

    <p>
      Aave is a decentralized liquidity protocol enabling users to lend
      and borrow digital assets without intermediaries.
    </p>

    <h3>Lending Pools</h3>
    <p>
      Users deposit assets into pools which become available for borrowing.
      Borrowers provide collateral to secure loans.
    </p>

    <h3>Interest Rate Model</h3>
    <p>
      Interest rates adjust automatically based on supply and demand,
      balancing liquidity across the system.
    </p>

    <h3>Overcollateralization</h3>
    <p>
      Loans require collateral worth more than the borrowed amount,
      protecting the protocol against default.
    </p>

    <h3>Liquidation Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
      If collateral value falls below safety thresholds, positions
      are liquidated automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>Flash Loans</h3>
    <p>
      Aave introduced flash loans — uncollateralized loans that must
      be repaid within a single transaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Oracle dependency</li>
      <li>Liquidation risk</li>
      <li>Smart contract vulnerabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD studies Aave to understand decentralized credit and
      algorithmic risk management.

  <!-- MAKERDAO -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <section class="protocol">
    <h2>Protocol Research: MakerDAO</h2>

    <p>
      MakerDAO is a decentralized protocol that issues DAI,
      a crypto-collateralized stablecoin.
    </p>

    <h3>DAI Stablecoin</h3>
    <p>
      DAI is generated when users lock collateral into smart contracts
      and mint debt against it.
    </p>

    <h3>Vaults (CDPs)</h3>
    <p>
      Collateralized vaults allow users to create DAI while enforcing
      minimum collateral ratios.
    </p>

    <h3>Stability Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>
      Stability fees, liquidation penalties, and governance controls
      help maintain DAI’s price stability.
    </p>

    <h3>Governance</h3>
    <p>
      MKR token holders vote on risk parameters, collateral types,
      and protocol upgrades.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>De-pegging risk</li>
      <li>Governance capture</li>
      <li>Oracle failures</li>
      <li>Liquidation cascades</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      WHYTEGOD studies MakerDAO as an experiment in decentralized money
      and on-chain monetary policy.
