      <h2>Protocol Research: Uniswap</h2>

      <p>
        Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol that allows users to trade
        tokens directly from their wallets without relying on order books or centralized intermediaries.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Mechanism</h3>
      <p>
        Uniswap uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. Instead of matching buyers and sellers,
        it relies on liquidity pools funded by users. Prices are determined algorithmically
        using a constant product formula:
      </p>

      <pre class="code-block">
x * y = k
      </pre>

      <p>
        Where <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> represent the quantities of two tokens in a pool,
        and <strong>k</strong> remains constant after each trade.
      </p>

      <h3>Liquidity Providers</h3>
      <p>
        Anyone can become a liquidity provider by depositing token pairs into a pool.
        In return, liquidity providers earn a portion of the trading fees proportional
        to their share of the pool.
      </p>

      <p>
        This model removes the need for traditional market makers but introduces new risks,
        including impermanent loss.
      </p>

      <h3>Permissionless Access</h3>
      <p>
        Uniswap does not require accounts, approvals, or custody.
        Any compatible wallet can interact with the protocol directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        This design improves accessibility but shifts responsibility entirely to the user.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations and Risks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Price slippage during large trades</li>
        <li>Impermanent loss for liquidity providers</li>
        <li>Smart contract risk</li>
        <li>Network congestion and gas costs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These trade-offs are structural, not bugs. Understanding them is critical
        to using decentralized systems responsibly.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Uniswap Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Uniswap demonstrates that open, non-custodial financial infrastructure
        can function at global scale without centralized control.
      </p>

      <p>
        WHYTEGOD studies protocols like Uniswap to understand
        where decentralization succeeds, where it fails,
        and how humans interact with these systems in reality.
