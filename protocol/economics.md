# Whytegod Protocol — Economic Model

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the economic behavior of the Whytegod Protocol.

It explains how demand, usage, and scarcity interact with the native
asset without introducing price controls, governance, or monetary policy.

This file defines incentives.
It does NOT define protocol rules.

---

## 2. Economic Philosophy

The Whytegod Protocol follows strict economic minimalism.

Principles:

- Fixed supply
- No inflation
- No price targeting
- No discretionary intervention

Value discovery is external to the protocol.

---

## 3. Native Asset

The protocol recognizes a single native asset:

- Primary unit: **WGD**
- Smallest unit: **Wert**
- Conversion: `1 WGD = 100,000,000 Wert`

WGD has no protocol-enforced valuation.

---

## 4. Supply Characteristics

- Total supply is fixed at genesis
- No additional WGD can ever be created
- No burn is required by protocol
- Lost WGD is permanently removed from circulation

Effective supply may decrease over time.

---

## 5. Demand Sources

Demand for WGD arises exclusively from protocol usage.

Primary demand drivers:

- Record submission
- Block inclusion competition
- Priority access during congestion

There are no artificial demand mechanisms.

---

## 6. Fee Model (Demand-Driven)

The protocol permits fees for record inclusion.

Fee properties:

- Fees are denominated in WGD
- Fees are measured in Wert
- Fee amounts are market-determined
- The protocol does not set prices

Higher demand naturally increases fee pressure.

---

## 7. Congestion Pressure

When demand exceeds block capacity:

- Users compete via higher fees
- Block producers select valid records
- No user is privileged

This creates a neutral, market-based allocation of space.

---

## 8. No Price Management

The protocol explicitly forbids:

- Pegs
- Stabilization mechanisms
- Algorithmic price control
- Supply expansion or contraction

Price volatility is external and unmanaged.

---

## 9. Incentive Neutrality

The protocol does not guarantee profit.

- Block production incentives are external
- Validator economics are implementation-specific
- No reward logic is enforced here

This preserves protocol simplicity.

---

## 10. Long-Term Scarcity Effects

As usage increases:

- Demand for WGD increases
- Effective supply may decrease due to loss
- Fee pressure reflects real usage

Scarcity emerges organically.

---

## 11. Non-Goals

This document does NOT define:

- Investment expectations
- Yield mechanisms
- Staking or locking
- Redistribution policies
- Economic governance

Those concerns are explicitly excluded.

---

## 12. Failure Tolerance

If economic assumptions fail:

- The protocol remains valid
- Records remain verifiable
- Supply remains fixed

Economic failure does not imply protocol failure.

---

## 13. Final Principle

The protocol enforces rules, not value.

WGD derives meaning only from voluntary use.
