    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>
      This page answers common questions about the Whytegod Protocol
      in clear, non-technical language.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is Whytegod?</h3>
    <p>
      Whytegod is a neutral protocol for creating and verifying
      permanent records using cryptographic hashes and public anchors.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What problem does it solve?</h3>
    <p>
      It provides a way to prove that specific data existed
      at a specific time without revealing the data itself.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Does Whytegod store my data?</h3>
    <p>
      No. The protocol never stores user data.
      Only cryptographic hashes are used.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is a record?</h3>
    <p>
      A record is a cryptographic hash derived from data.
      The original data always stays with the user.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is anchoring?</h3>
    <p>
      Anchoring is the act of publishing a record hash
      to an immutable public system such as a blockchain
      or append-only log.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Can records be changed or deleted?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Once a record is anchored, it is immutable.
      This permanence is a core property of the protocol.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is verification?</h3>
    <p>
      Verification is the process of recomputing a hash
      and comparing it with an anchored record.
      Verification is always free and permissionless.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is the token used for?</h3>
    <p>
      The token is a utility mechanism used to prevent spam,
      rate-limit anchoring, and support protocol sustainability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Is the token an investment?</h3>
    <p>
      No. The token does not represent equity, ownership,
      profit rights, or dividends.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Do I need the token to verify records?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Verification does not require a token.
      Tokens are only relevant for anchoring actions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Who controls Whytegod?</h3>
    <p>
      No one. The protocol has no administrators,
      no override keys, and no centralized authority.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Can the protocol rules change?</h3>
    <p>
      Existing rules and records cannot change.
      New versions may be proposed, but adoption is voluntary.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Is Whytegod tied to any blockchain?</h3>
    <p>
      No. The protocol is blockchain-agnostic
      and can anchor records on any immutable system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Is this legal?</h3>
    <p>
      Whytegod defines technical rules only.
      Legal interpretation depends on jurisdiction and use case.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What happens if the website disappears?</h3>
    <p>
      Nothing breaks. Verification depends only on hashes
      and public anchors, not on this website.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="note">
    <p>
      Whytegod provides tools for verification —
      responsibility for usage rests with the user.
