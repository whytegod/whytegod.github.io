    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>
      This page answers common questions about the Whytegod Protocol
      in direct, non-marketing language.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is Whytegod?</h3>
    <p>
      Whytegod is a neutral protocol for creating and verifying
      permanent records using cryptographic hashes and public anchors.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What problem does it solve?</h3>
    <p>
      It proves that specific data existed, unchanged,
      at or before a known point in time —
      without storing the data itself.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Is Whytegod a blockchain?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Whytegod does not run a chain or consensus.
      It relies on existing immutable public systems for anchoring.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is a WRID?</h3>
    <p>
      A WRID (Whytegod Record ID) is a SHA-256 hash
      derived from original data.
      It uniquely represents that data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Does Whytegod store my data?</h3>
    <p>
      No. The protocol never stores user data,
      files, identities, or metadata.
      Only hashes are used.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What does “anchoring” mean?</h3>
    <p>
      Anchoring means publishing a WRID
      to an immutable public system
      such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a public log.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What makes a record valid?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The hash is deterministic</li>
      <li>The anchor is immutable</li>
      <li>The timestamp is verifiable</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Can records be changed or deleted?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Once anchored, a record
      cannot be altered or revoked.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What is WGD?</h3>
    <p>
      WGD is a utility token used to introduce
      cost and friction when anchoring records.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Is WGD an investment or security?</h3>
    <p>
      No. WGD provides no ownership,
      profit rights, or governance power.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Do I need WGD to verify records?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Verification is free and permissionless.
      WGD is only used when anchoring new records.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Who controls the protocol?</h3>
    <p>
      No one.
      Whytegod has no governance,
      administrators, or privileged actors.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Can the protocol rules change?</h3>
    <p>
      No. The protocol is frozen per version.
      Any changes require a new version.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>What does verification actually prove?</h3>
    <p>
      It proves data integrity and existence in time.
      It does not prove ownership, truth, or intent.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="note">
    <p>
      Whytegod defines cryptographic facts only.
      Interpretation is external to the protocol.
